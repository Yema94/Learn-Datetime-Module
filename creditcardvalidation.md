#creditcardvalidation.py is a python code, 
that validates the expiry date of the credit card.
that uses datetime module and its methods to get the real time and date.

modules that I have used in this code so far are: now()/today(), date(yyyy, mm, dd)

P.S. It is a very simple program for learning purpose.
